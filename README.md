With computer controlled ignition systems, adaptive suspension systems, and built-in vibration
damping, it can be difficult for the average driver to detect mechanical trouble in their vehicles.
Even when a driver notices an unusual noise or a new vibration they often have no way of
knowing if it is caused by normal wear and tear. A vehicle diagnostic tool known as the
Automotive Vibration Analyzer (AVA) has been designed to aid the driver in interpreting these
noises and vibrations. The AVA contains a sensor to capture the vehicle vibrations and a
microprocessor to calculate and plot the frequency spectrum of those vibrations on a 7-inch
display screen for comparison to other recorded vibration spectrums.
