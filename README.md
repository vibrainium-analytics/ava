# Welecome to the AVA developer's zone #

### Repository Purpose ###

* Provide location for central code storage for Vibrainium Analytics team.
* Live, up-to-date code changes for all team members to contribute

### Setup ###

* Clone the Repository to your local directory
* Start making changes, and push updates to BitBucket

### Contribution guidelines ###

* "master" branch is *always* reserved for a working copy of the app.
* Please DO NOT make commits directly to master.  Instead, work on the "develop" branch.
* From "develop" make branches using feature/feature_name or hotfix/hoxfix_name notation for consistency.
* When finished with code changes on your new branch, submit a pull request for another team member to review.  The other team member will complete the merge of the new branch into "develop" if the code checks out well.

### Standard Coding Procedures ###
* File names - Upper_Case
* class - Upper_Case
* def - lower_case
* objects, buttons, labels - camelCase

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Contact Spencer if you need assistance in setup or repo branching / merging guidelines or before making changes to "master".
